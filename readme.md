## Instructions


- Extracting information from the title

- Downloading the entire text of the rule and creating a topic model

- Performing entity extraction from the abstract and/or entire text of the rule to enhance the feature space

- Anything of interest in the data that you think would be of value

Following the creation of these features (both from the unstructured and structured portion of the data), a classifier needs to be built that distinguishes between rules made during these administrations. For any topics that show a high level of importance in distinguishing between the two administrations, please create a relevant chart(s) which show some descriptive statistics about these potential variables.

Please produce code with technical comments a Data Scientist could understand and a brief (1-2 page) and non-partisan written report a lay person could understand.
